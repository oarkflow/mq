# Admin Server Working! üéâ

The MQ Admin Server is now successfully running on port 8090!

## ‚úÖ What was fixed:

The issue was that the `broker.Start(ctx)` method contains an infinite loop to accept connections, which was blocking the main thread. The solution was to start the broker in a goroutine.

## üîß Key Fix:

```go
// Start broker in goroutine since it blocks
go func() {
    if err := broker.Start(ctx); err != nil {
        log.Printf("Broker error: %v", err)
    }
}()

// Give broker time to start
time.Sleep(500 * time.Millisecond)
```

## üåê Available Endpoints:

The admin server is now responding on the following endpoints:

- **Dashboard**: http://localhost:8090/admin
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:8090/api/admin/health
- **Broker Info**: http://localhost:8090/api/admin/broker
- **Queues**: http://localhost:8090/api/admin/queues
- **Consumers**: http://localhost:8090/api/admin/consumers
- **Pools**: http://localhost:8090/api/admin/pools
- **Metrics**: http://localhost:8090/api/admin/metrics

```bash
$ curl -s http://localhost:8090/api/admin/broker | jq .

  "status": "running",
  "address": ":54019",
  "uptime": 24804,
  "connections": 0,
  "config": {
    "max_connections": 1000,
    "queue_size": 100,
    "read_timeout": "30s",
    "sync_mode": false,
    "worker_pool": false,
    "write_timeout": "30s"
  }
}
```

## üöÄ Usage:

```bash
# Run the minimal admin demo
cd examples/minimal_admin
go run main.go

# Or run the full admin demo
cd examples/admin
go run main.go
```

Both should now work correctly with the broker starting in a goroutine!
