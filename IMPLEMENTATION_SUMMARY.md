    mq.WithTaskStorage(storage),
    mq.WithCircuitBreaker(mq.CircuitBreakerConfig{
        Enabled:          true,
        FailureThreshold: 5,
        ResetTimeout:     30 * time.Second,
    }),
    mq.WithMaxMemoryLoad(512 * 1024 * 1024), // 512MB
    mq.WithBatchSize(10),
)

// Monitor health
health := pool.GetHealthStatus()
if !health.IsHealthy {
    log.Printf("Pool issues: %v", health.Issues)
}

// Get metrics
metrics := pool.FormattedMetrics()
log.Printf("Throughput: %.2f tasks/sec", metrics.TasksPerSecond)

// Graceful shutdown
pool.Stop()
```
