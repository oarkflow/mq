// Create enhanced DAG with workflow capabilities
config := &dag.EnhancedDAGConfig{
    EnableWorkflowEngine: true,
    EnableStateManagement: true,
    EnableAdvancedRetry: true,
}
enhancedDAG, _ := dag.NewEnhancedDAG("workflow", "key", config)

// Create workflow engine with all features
engine := dag.NewWorkflowEngineManager(&dag.WorkflowEngineConfig{
    MaxConcurrentExecutions: 10,
    EnableSecurity: true,
    EnableScheduling: true,
})

// Use any of the 8 advanced processors
factory := engine.GetProcessorFactory()
htmlProcessor, _ := factory.CreateProcessor("html", config)
